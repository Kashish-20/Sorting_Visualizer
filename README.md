# Sorting_Visualizer

The Sorting Visualizer is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to visually demonstrate the functioning of various sorting algorithms. The project includes implementations of popular sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort, and heap sort. Each sorting algorithm is illustrated with sound effects to enhance the user experience. The visualizer helps in understanding the step-by-step process of how these algorithms sort data, making it an excellent educational tool for learning and teaching sorting algorithms.
